<p>This PC Replacement Agreement (Agreement) is made by and between The Electronic Information Network, a nonprofit corporation organized under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (EIN), and the EIN Participating Library identified above (LIBRARY).  The Addendum is to cover any equipment added co-terminus to the 2014 PC Replacement Program Agreement (Original Agreement) after the initial installment and deployment.  All terms and conditions of the Original Agreement are considered to be included in the Addendum.  EIN and LIBRARY agree as follows:</p>
<p></p>
<ol><li><strong>Equipment Description.</strong>
<p>EIN has entered into three year agreements with computer manufacturers, various service and software providers, and leasing agents for computer systems. Through this Addendum EIN offers to the LIBRARY the following equipment for use by libraries.</p>
<p>Desktops, Monitor and All-in-Ones (AIOs). Offered equipment is detailed on Schedule B (incorporated and made part of this Addendum); and includes multiple desktop configurations and multiple flat panel monitor options.</p>

<p>All software necessary for use with standard EIN systems is also included.  Non-standard EIN software purchased by the LIBRARY may be installed on the new computer systems providing that the license is transferable and the software is compatible with the Microsoft Operating System.</p>
  
<p>The equipment also includes a three-year hardware warranty for the term of the Original Agreement. This hardware warranty includes maintenance on all PC internal parts, monitor, mouse, and keyboard. EIN Help Desk will coordinate all hardware support for PCs included in this Addendum and covered under warranty.</p></li>
<p></p>

<p>LIBRARY agrees to assume sole responsibility for the Equipment and to pay EIN replacement costs for any damage to or loss of the Equipment (outside the warranty) while in LIBRARYâ€™s custody.</p>  

<p>Libraries may install non-standard software (software not included in the base EIN image delivered on the computers).  If necessary when equipment or software problems occur, the eiNetwork will provide only the then current standard base image offered by EIN.</p></li>
 <p></p> 
<li><strong>Equipment Protection and Use.</strong>
<p>LIBRARY acknowledges its sole responsibility for equipment while within Library custody.  LIBRARY shall notify EIN promptly of any loss, damage or theft of the Equipment.  LIBRARY shall take all reasonable steps to secure physical access to and use of the Equipment.</p>

<p>The LIBRARY is responsible for insuring all program assets that are part of this Addendum and also agrees to follow the EIN guidelines, policies, and standards for purposes of ensuring successful and secure use of EIN hardware and software.</p> 

<p>This equipment is intended for use by LIBRARY staff and patrons.  LIBRARY shall not share the Equipment with any third party other than LIBRARY staff and patrons.</p>

<p>The LIBRARY acknowledges that this equipment will be removed from the Network at program termination.</p></li>
<p></p>
<li><strong>Term and Termination.</strong>

<p></p>
<li><strong>Governing Law, Jurisdiction.</strong>
<p>This Addendum and all matters arising out of or relating to this Addendum, shall be governed by the internal laws, and not the laws of conflicts, of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, USA.</p>

<p>No failure or delay on the part of either party in the exercise of any right, power or remedy under this Addendum shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, power or remedy preclude other or further exercise thereof, or the exercise of any other right, power or remedy.</p>

<p>Neither party shall be liable for failure to perform hereunder if the failure results from a cause beyond its control, including, without limitation, fire, electrical, mechanical, or equipment breakdowns, delays by third party vendors (such as, but not limited to, shipping delays attributable to the hardware manufacturer), civil disturbances or disorders, strikes, Acts of God or acts or omissions by the other party.</p></li>
